      description: >
        Welcome to the Quilt Community Collab Program, Quilt's answer to the rampant bigotry and harassment that has
        long rooted itself in the Minecraft community.


        The Program exists to facilitate information-sharing between Minecraft-related communities, and allow staff
        members from participating communities to collaborate on moderation, community design, and event planning. Our
        goal is to try to improve the entire Minecraft community sphere for everyone, by allowing for the early warning
        of community threats, problem users, targeted attacks and trending social issues.


        The Program was born out of a need for change in the Minecraft community. It's long been the case that 
        the Minecraft community has been a hotbed of bigotry and harmful behaviour, and this is Quilt's way of
        supporting the community sphere it exists in - giving back to the minorities that ultimately resulted in its
        reason to exist.


        If you're new here, we'd appreciate if you could introduce yourself in the <#905442871539277855> channel!


        Despite this being a work-oriented space, we hope you enjoy your time with us. Feel free to contact a
        <@&905218921605513276> if you need anything!

- type: rules

  rules:
    Follow Quilt's Code of Conduct: >
      Everyone is expected to read and abide by our [Code of Conduct](http://quiltmc.org/community/code-of-conduct)

    Follow Discord's rules: >
      As a Discord-based community, we require everyone to follow Discord's
      [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines) and [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms)

    Try to speak English: >
      The common language in our community is English, but we understand that not everyone speaks English at the same
      level. Try to speak English to the best of your ability, and don't worry if you need to use translation tools. We
      will not tolerate making fun of people for poor English.

    This is not a popularity contest: >
      You are expected to behave professionally here and provide quality contributions to our community when you can.
      Try not to be consumed by hubris, and remember that everyone is here to do their best for their users - even if
      you disagree with their methods, or aren't the biggest fan of specific communities or their staff members.

    Prioritise your safety and mental health: >
      It's extremely important that you look after yourself before anyone else - even if you would prefer to sacrifice
      your mental health to work on something here. You can't look after other people if you don't look after yourself,
      and it's going to be impossible for you to handle your community work if you overload yourself.

    Don't create accessibility problems: >
      For example, by posting flashing images or emoji, setting a blank avatar, impersonating other users or making
      your name hard to read.

    Don't gatekeep: >
      Specifically, don't treat other communities here with contempt unless there is a legitimate issue, and don't look
      down on communities that don't follow your infraction system or have rules that don't match your own.

    Be respectful and patient: >
      Not everyone here will have the same level of experience. Additionally, while any form of discrimination or hate
      speech is grounds for permanent removal of a user (or community) from this project, please try to educate other
      members when they accidentally say something harmful.

    Use the channels properly: >
      Always check the description of a channel, **and its pins,** before using it.
    
    Do not blindly sync infractions: >
      The Program is intended to help keep you and your coworkers informed. All moderation actions that you take in
      your community spaces should be properly researched, and we heavily advise against blindly syncing bans or other
      infractions from the other communities that are part of the Program.

      The Program is not meant to be used as a way to perform character assasinations, and different communities that
      are part of the Program will have different rulesets. While we try to be clear on the information provided in
      any form of infraction logging, it's important that you double check to make sure that any infractions you carry
      over to your spaces should actually be applied under your community's rules and policies.

      Communities that are found to be blindly syncing infractions to their communities risk being permanently removed
      from the Program.
